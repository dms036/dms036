- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Declan. A recent University of Nottingham graduate, with degrees in BSc Biology and MSc Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a broad range of topics, but these can generally be condensed down to Python programming, deep learning and cyber security. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning socket programming, with the intent to expand my programming repertoire and develop essential industry skills such as git/github.
      I'll be using github as an online repository for any personal projects I'm currently developing or have previously worked on.
